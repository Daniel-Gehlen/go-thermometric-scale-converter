# Challenge

The task is to create a Go program that converts the boiling point of water from Kelvin to Celsius. The boiling point of water is 373.15 Kelvin.

## Methods

1. **Import the `fmt` package**: The `fmt` package is used for formatted printing and input/output operations.

2. **Define the Kelvin temperature**: The Kelvin temperature of water is defined as a constant variable.

3. **Convert Kelvin to Celsius**: The Celsius temperature is calculated by subtracting 273.15 from the Kelvin temperature.

4. **Print the result**: The Celsius temperature is printed to the console using the `fmt.Printf` function.
